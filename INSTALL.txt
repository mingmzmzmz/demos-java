- make sure that your java is configured correctly:
	java -version
	javac -version
	echo $JAVA_HOME
	should all agree.
- make sure you have python installed.
- run './scripts/ubuntu_install.py' to make sure you have all pre-requisites.
- run "make" to build everything.

- to get a fresh copy of the libs (takes time), run:
	ant ivy_retrieve
