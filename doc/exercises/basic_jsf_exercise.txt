First part:
	create a JSF form with the following attributes:
		- Name - just a single single with no spaces
		- Surname - same as name
		- Gender - select one out of male female
		- Birth year - int between 1900 and 2020
		- Submit button.
	Write a server side single bean to hold this info.
	At this phase do no validations.

Second part:
	Add validations to the above (use google).
	See that the validations prevent injection of data
	into your bean.

Third part:
	Style errors for your page, in specfic terms,
	make them all appear purple instead of what ever
	color they appear.
