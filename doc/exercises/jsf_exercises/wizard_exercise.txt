create a multi pages wizard.

Lets say pages are called a,b,c,...,e

Regular flow is:
	a -> b -> c -> d -> e

If you answer a certain question in the negative in a,
 you will pass from c to e directly.
	a -> b -> c -> e

If you answer a certain question in the position in b,
	you will be redirected to f after d and then back
	to the regular flow (e)
	a -> b -> c -> d -> f -> e
