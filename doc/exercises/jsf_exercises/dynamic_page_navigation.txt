dynamic page navigation exercise
=================================
- create three pages a, b and c (a.xhtml, b.xhtml and c.xhtml).
- create a button on page 'a'.
- when the button is pressed navigate to 'b' 50 percent of the time
and to 'c' in the remaining 50 percent.

second phase:
- now use faces-config.xml and make dynamic descision be followed
by a static rule in faces-config.xml.
- your dyamic method will return "ok" and "error"
- "ok" will route to c.xhtml
- "error" will route to b.xhtml

NOTE: "ok" and "error" are called in JSF2.0 terminology "outcomes".

Question:
what if you press the browsers "back" button? Do you go back?
