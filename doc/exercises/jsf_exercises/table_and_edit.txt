Show a table of cars.
The table should show a list of cars and their various
properties: model, year, color, license plate...
Once you select a specific row of the table and click "edit"
you switch view to a view that allows you to edit
the properties of that specific car.
Once I press "OK" after editing the car details I get transferred
to the table again.
